description: >
  This model is a replication of the model described in the GoogleNet publication. We would like to thank Christian Szegedy for all his help in the replication of GoogleNet model.
  Differences:
  not training with the relighting data-augmentation;
  not training with the scale or aspect-ratio data-augmentation;
  uses "xavier" to initialize the weights instead of "gaussian";
  quick_solver.prototxt uses a different learning rate decay policy than the original solver.prototxt, that allows a much faster training (60 epochs vs 250 epochs);
  The bundled model is the iteration 2,400,000 snapshot (60 epochs) using quick_solver.prototxt
  This bundled model obtains a top-1 accuracy 68.7% (31.3% error) and a top-5 accuracy 88.9% (11.1% error) on the validation set, using just the center crop.
  (Using the average of 10 crops, (4 + 1 center) * 2 mirror, should obtain a bit higher accuracy.)
  Timings for bvlc_googlenet with cuDNN using batch_size:128 on a K40c:
  Average Forward pass: 562.841 ms.
  Average Backward pass: 1123.84 ms.
  Average Forward-Backward: 1688.8 ms.
  This model was trained by Sergio Guadarrama @sguada
